It's just like a blog application. but here it's intended as a place where users can write there diaries. some of it's functionalities are: likes,comments, drafts, following system...

### What i used:

-**Django**: backend
-**django-ckeditor**: Diray content editor.
-**django-crispy-forms**: To render forms
- ...

for production:

-**python-decouple**: To store sensative data as environement variables.
-**dj-database-url**: Instead of DB_USER, DB_HOST... use DATABASE_URL
-**django-storages + dropbox**: Where i store media files.

Well, there is much more to go.
